## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Vehicle_length and Ground Cleanace are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the the mpg values in the dataset.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Since P value(5.77 ) is way lesser than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefor, we can state that there is sufficiuent evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis so we can state that the slope of our linear model is not Zero.

Through R-squared value is 0.71, but looking at he significant value of Intercept  - Verify with TA
